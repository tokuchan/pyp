Contributing to e-pyp
=====================

I welcome contributions in the form of well-formatted pull requests. In
general, if you want me to take your contribution seriously, you should follow
the guidelines for Linux kernel commit messages. In brief, they are:

* The first line is the subject line, and cannot have more than 72 characters.
  (This is because it needs to be indentable by 8 characters, and still fit in
  80).
* The subject line consists of three parts:
** [tags in square brackets]
** one or two words describing the area that the commit affects, followed by a
   colon (:)
** a brief statement of the purpose of the commit, captialized, in the
   imperative form, and lacking a period
* There needs to be one blank line after the subject line
* There should be one or two paragraphs describing the problem. Basically,
  answer this question: what's wrong with the way things are done right now?
* There should be one or two paragraphs describing the solution. Basically,
  tell me how this commit solves the problem specified in the first paragraph.

Notice, this means that each commit can really only talk about one thing! I
want the pull request to tell a story, in discrete chunks, about how you
noticed problems and solved each. This is the only way I can hope to keep this
organized in the long run.

Thanks for your attention, and I hope that you decide to contribute!

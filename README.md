e-pyp
=====

Welcome to *e-pyp*, an /extended/ `pyp`. The original, from which this project
is forked, can be found here: code.google.com/p/pyp.

What's different from this version? Lots! We have first class support for
regexes, auto-templated quotes, the ability to pipe to and from the x-selection
or clipboard, and the ability to parse additional options---after `pyp`'s
own---via the excellent `docopt` module. Download a copy and check it out!
